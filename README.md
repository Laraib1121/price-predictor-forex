# Real-Time Stock Price Prediction System

A sophisticated real-time stock prediction system that provides buy/sell recommendations at 12pm based on 4-hour price predictions. The system uses LSTM neural networks with sentiment analysis from Reddit and news sources to make accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Real-time Predictions**: Predicts stock prices 4 hours ahead
- **Automated Alerts**: Sends buy/sell signals at 12pm daily
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrates Reddit and news sentiment data
- **Technical Indicators**: Uses comprehensive technical analysis
- **LSTM Neural Networks**: Advanced deep learning for price prediction
- **Configurable**: Easy to customize via JSON configuration
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging and alert history

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd price-predictor-stocks

# Run the setup script
python setup.py
```

### 2. Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize your settings:

```json
{
    "ticker": "NVDA",
    "lookback_days": 60,
    "prediction_hours": 4,
    "alert_time": "12:00",
    "buy_threshold": 1.0,
    "sell_threshold": -1.0,
    "confidence_threshold": 0.5,
    "training_epochs": 100,
    "batch_size": 32,
    "learning_rate": 0.001,
    "enable_sentiment_analysis": true,
    "enable_technical_indicators": true,
    "log_level": "INFO",
    "save_alerts_to_file": true,
    "alert_file": "trading_alerts.txt",
    "log_file": "stock_alerts.log"
}
```

### 3. Optional: Reddit API Setup

For enhanced sentiment analysis, set up Reddit API credentials:

1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Create a new app
3. Edit the credential files with your credentials:

```bash
# Edit client_id.txt
echo "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" > client_id.txt

# Edit client_secret.txt  
echo "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" > client_secret.txt

# Edit pw.txt
echo "YOUR_REDDIT_PASSWORD" > pw.txt
```

**Note**: The system uses username `InterestingRun2732` by default (as in the original notebook).

### 4. Run the System

```bash
# Run the enhanced version (recommended)
python src/enhanced_stock_alert.py

# Or run the basic version
python src/real_time_stock_alert.py
```

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
- **Historical Data**: Fetches daily stock data using Yahoo Finance API
- **Technical Indicators**: Calculates 20+ technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- **Sentiment Data**: Collects sentiment from Reddit and news sources

### 2. Model Training
- **LSTM Neural Network**: Uses Long Short-Term Memory networks for time series prediction
- **Feature Engineering**: Combines price data, technical indicators, and sentiment
- **Sequence Learning**: Learns patterns from historical data sequences

### 3. Prediction Process
- **Real-time Data**: Gets current stock price
- **4-Hour Forecast**: Predicts price 4 hours ahead
- **Signal Generation**: Compares current vs predicted price
- **Alert System**: Sends buy/sell recommendations

### 4. Alert System
- **Daily Schedule**: Runs analysis at 12pm daily
- **Signal Types**: BUY, SELL, or HOLD recommendations
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for predictions
- **Logging**: Saves all alerts to file

## Configuration Options

### Stock Settings
- `ticker`: Stock symbol (e.g., "NVDA", "AAPL", "TSLA")
- `lookback_days`: Historical data period for training
- `prediction_hours`: Hours ahead to predict (default: 4)

### Alert Settings
- `alert_time`: Time to run daily analysis (format: "HH:MM")
- `buy_threshold`: Minimum % increase for BUY signal
- `sell_threshold`: Minimum % decrease for SELL signal
- `confidence_threshold`: Minimum confidence for signal

### Model Settings
- `training_epochs`: Number of training iterations
- `batch_size`: Training batch size
- `learning_rate`: Model learning rate

### Features
- `enable_sentiment_analysis`: Enable/disable sentiment analysis
- `enable_technical_indicators`: Enable/disable technical indicators
- `save_alerts_to_file`: Save alerts to file

## Technical Indicators Used

- **Moving Averages**: 5, 10, 20, 50, 200-day
- **RSI**: Relative Strength Index
- **MACD**: Moving Average Convergence Divergence
- **Bollinger Bands**: Upper, Lower, Middle bands
- **Volume Analysis**: Volume ratios and trends
- **Price Changes**: Daily and weekly price changes
- **Volatility**: Price volatility measures
- **Support/Resistance**: Dynamic support and resistance levels

## Sentiment Analysis

### Reddit Sentiment
- Analyzes posts from r/stocks, r/investing
- Searches for mentions of the target stock
- Calculates weighted sentiment scores
- Considers upvotes, comments, and post scores

### News Sentiment
- Collects news from Yahoo Finance
- Analyzes article headlines and content
- Provides real-time sentiment scores
- Tracks news volume and sentiment trends
